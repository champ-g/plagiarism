At the heart of Machine Learning (ML) is its capacity to analyze large datasets and uncover valuable insights. This capability has been fueled by significant improvements in computational resources, the availability of vast amounts of data, and the creation of advanced algorithms. ML can be categorized into three primary types: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, each offering distinct approaches to model training. In supervised learning, models learn from labeled data to make predictions or classifications. Unsupervised learning, by contrast, seeks to identify patterns or groupings within unlabeled data. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning focuses on training agents to make decisions by maximizing cumulative rewards. These diverse methodologies have paved the way for a wide array of applications, from predictive analytics to self-driving cars.
